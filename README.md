# Assignment_10_Stars
Extra Credit Assignment Plotting nearest stars to earth using data from  http://www.recons.org/ in the txt file. Sparse matrix data structure.

This week we have been working mostly with pencil and paper.  The programming was limited to timing algorithms to confirm that if theypic were supposed to be N2 time complexity, they really were N2 time complexity (or logN or N).  Aside from examples that you might investigate, there is not much for you to do in your IDE -- but don't worry - I'll find something in your assignment.  Meanwhile, let's have some fun and introduce a database and class that we may use later in the quarter for extra credit or research.  It consists of the 100 nearest stars to Earth, and it is updated every year to reflect newly discovered stars that might bump some stars off the list (much like a song on the pop charts bumps off other songs as popularity changes, except in this case, the stars positions are not changing -- only our improved measurements of what is there is;  over millions of years, the stars will change positions, but that's somebody else's problem).

100 stars is such a miniscule subset of the stars in our galaxy, which  picnumber in the hundreds of billions, that you might think that working with this set is really uninteresting.  However the distances to even the nearest star is so far that it will be thousands of years, at best, before we can even send probes to these start to study them.

So, how far away are they?  That's one of the things we'll find out.  Also, we'll build a map on our screens that will give visual information that you cannot get anywhere on the web.  We are massaging actual data in new ways.

The data is from this site: http://www.recons.org/ and a list of the information you will be reading into your programs looks pretty much like this: http://www.recons.org/TOP100.posted.htm.

The source and data for your use in the course are in the resources for the class, and you can get to it directly by clicking  here:

StarNearEarth Resources
, and unzipping the archive anywhere onto your hard drive.  In your StarNearEarth folder,  you'll have a Read Me file telling you how to incorporate the .java and data files into your project, and you'll also have a sample main() to get you started.  Get those items working first, and then you can come back to read more.
